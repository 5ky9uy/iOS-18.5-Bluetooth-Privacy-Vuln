# Bluetooth Hijacked for Silent Scanning and GPS Harvesting — iOS 18.5

**Author:** Joseph Goydish II
**Date of Discovery:** June 24, 2025
**Test Device:** iPhone 14 Pro Max
**iOS Version:** 18.5
**Severity:** High
**Tools Used:** Apple Console.app (macOS) via USB
**Test Environment:** Stock iOS (no jailbreak, no MDM, no third-party tools)

**Log Evidence:**
(https://ia801505.us.archive.org/16/items/bluetooth-hacks-your-life/ios18.5_silent_tracking_console_capture.mov)

**Summary**

This report documents a reproducible series of system-level privacy violations in iOS 18.5, in which native Apple system daemons:

* Expose Bluetooth trust metadata
* Initiate background BLE scans without user interaction
* Trigger GPS-based location harvesting without consent
* Bypass user-facing privacy control mechanisms

All of these behaviors occur without any UI indicators, prompts, or active app involvement.

These findings were collected using Apple’s own diagnostic tools on a clean iPhone with no modifications. All activity observed was native to iOS and requires no third-party applications or tampering.

**Vulnerability Details**

---

**VF-001 — Exposure of Bluetooth Trust Metadata**

Component: audioaccessoryd

Description:
This daemon exposes metadata for previously trusted Bluetooth Low Energy accessories, including Identity Resolving Keys (IRKs) and pairing states — even when those devices are powered off or disconnected.

Log Evidence:

```
Read IRK for device A8:BE:27:17:94:26 : result 0  
init cloud - found 0 paired LE devices in local keychain  
```

Impact:

* Leaks historical device trust relationships
* Enables passive tracking and identity correlation

---

**VF-002 — Silent BLE Scanning**

Component: SPCBPeripheralManager

Description:
Accessing trust metadata triggers silent Bluetooth Low Energy scanning in the background, with no foreground app activity or user-visible indicators.

Log Evidence:

```
SPCBPeripheralManager: Created session for <<hash>>:com.apple.bluetoothd  
SPCBPeripheralManager: fetch duration: 17.61 ms  
```

Impact:

* Device becomes passively discoverable
* Enables silent environmental mapping or passive surveillance

---

**VF-003 — Covert GPS Activation**

Component: locationd

Description:
GPS-based location harvesting is activated silently — with no consent dialog, app invocation, or system UI indicator.

Log Evidence:

```
"updateHarvestingAllowed", "isHarvestingEnabled":1  
"Harvesting is forced to be allowed,0"  
```

Impact:

* Location data collected without user consent
* Violates iOS’s stated privacy protections

---

**VF-004 — TCC Framework Bypass**

Component: tccd

Description:
By setting the `preflight=yes` flag, system processes bypass Apple’s TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) framework, which enforces permission checks for Bluetooth access.

Log Evidence:

```
TCCAccessRequest, service=kTCCServiceBluetoothAlways, preflight=yes, client_dict=(null)  
```

Impact:

* Silent privilege escalation
* Permission enforcement bypassed at the system level

---

**VF-005 — Continued Trust Logic After Cryptographic Failure**

Component: bluetoothd

Description:
Even when access to keychain material fails (e.g., missing or corrupted crypto keys), trust metadata continues to be processed and surfaced.

Log Evidence:

```
Failed to query key chain magic key data ... result 150  
Read IRK for device C8:7B:23:93:6F:C7 : result 150  
```

Impact:

* Trust logic proceeds in degraded security state
* Weakens platform integrity and resilience

---

**Behavioral Sequence**

During a single session of console logging, the following occurred:

1. `audioaccessoryd` accessed Bluetooth trust metadata
2. `SPCBPeripheralManager` initiated BLE scans
3. `locationd` activated GPS harvesting silently
4. `tccd` bypassed the TCC framework using `preflight=yes`
5. `bluetoothd` continued trust operations despite cryptographic failures

Together, these components form a passive telemetry pipeline that violates iOS’s user-facing privacy model.

---

**Risk Assessment**

* **Metadata Exposure:** Trust data is revealed even when no devices are connected.
* **Silent BLE Discovery:** Background BLE scans occur with no user prompt.
* **Covert Location Access:** GPS data is collected without indicators or consent.
* **Consent Bypass:** TCC protections are silently bypassed.
* **Crypto Integrity Failure:** Trust logic continues despite keychain or credential failure.

---

**Reproducibility**

* Device: iPhone 14 Pro Max
* OS Version: iOS 18.5
* Tools: Apple Console.app (macOS)
* Test Environment: Clean install with no jailbreak, MDM, or third-party apps
* Observed Daemons:

  * audioaccessoryd
  * bluetoothd
  * tccd
  * locationd
  * SPCBPeripheralManager

---

**Supporting Materials**

* Redacted console logs
* Annotated log excerpts by vulnerability
* Reproduction steps and configuration notes

---

**Conclusion**

The behaviors observed in iOS 18.5 reflect a coordinated system-level approach to collecting Bluetooth and GPS metadata without user awareness or consent. Key findings:

* Trust metadata is exposed without visibility
* BLE and GPS collection is silently triggered
* TCC protections are bypassed at runtime
* Cryptographic enforcement is not required to proceed

This design architecture poses a **serious privacy risk**, especially in high-security or adversarial environments. It challenges Apple's public privacy guarantees and opens the door to persistent, covert tracking of users.
